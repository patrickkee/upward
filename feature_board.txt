******* Backlog ********
* Event details date is not updated after deleting part of the date, editing another field, and clicking cancel. 
	- The correct date value is passed in as props and should re-render with the full date rather than something like 01/01/202, but it doesn't
* Refactor the Store to sync with the server asynchronously while maintaining the local store as persistence. 
* Get rid of com.patrickkee.api.event - it's not useful and has been replaced by defaulting logic in the Event constructor
